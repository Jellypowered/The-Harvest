Features:
1. Butchering a Mechanoid Scyther corpse MAY yield two Scyther Blades, just like how could you get elephant tusks. However, This appears to not be working since B19. 
If you have a mod that allows Scythers to have blades again, in thoery this should work. Put this mod AFTER that mod. 
2. Butchering a corpse with any implants or added parts will also yield that parts, like bionic eyes.
3. (Optional, default off) Butchering a corpse with any harvestable natural organs will also yield that organs, like heart and liver.
You can configure this in the mod settings. 

Incompatibility: None
Old Save Compatible: Yes
Safely Removable: Yes
